While working as a Brand Ambassador for Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, I noticed a recurring inefficiency: we were tracking our daily outreach and donations using paper forms, which often got lost or left behindâ€”and wasted a lot of resources.

I took the initiative to design a digital version of the tracking system to make the process more efficient, eco-friendly, and accessible for the team. This online tool allowed ambassadors to log their progress remotely, helping reduce paper waste and improve team productivity.

The first version had a few bugs, but it was a functional prototype that showed real potential for impact. It sparked interest among team members and demonstrated how small tech solutions can solve real problems in everyday work environments.
