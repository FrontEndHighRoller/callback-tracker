# 📝 Callback Tracker

> A digital system I created for Brand Ambassadors at Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital to replace inefficient paper tracking.

While working as a Brand Ambassador for Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, I noticed our outreach and donation logs were recorded on paper forms that were often lost, and this slowed down the team. To fix this, I built an online tracking tool that let ambassadors log progress remotely, reduced paper waste, and improved productivity.

The prototype wasn’t perfect, but it worked—and it sparked interest across the team, showing how small tech solutions can make everyday workflows smoother and more efficient.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Translating **real-world workflow problems** into a web application  
- Handling **form validation and dynamic DOM updates**  
- Using **SVG icons** for interactive visual feedback  
- Designing **user-friendly interfaces** for non-technical users  
- Building a **prototype that demonstrates impact**  

> 📌 This project started as a personal initiative while working as a Brand Ambassador. It was inspired by recurring inefficiencies with paper tracking and demonstrates how small tech solutions can solve everyday problems.
